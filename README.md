# SwiftStructure
A Support-set programs which implements common Data structure in SWIFT 3.0 


This series provides an introduction to commonly used data structures and algorithms written in Swift 3.0 . While details of many algorithms exists on Wikipedia, these implementations are often written as pseudocode, or are expressed in C or C++. With Swift available as open source, its general syntax should be familiar enough for most programmers to understand.
